<p align="justify">Hello, my name is Doug, and I recently completed my Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University. My background is a little unique in the Data Science world, as I have spent several years in talent acquisition, sales, management, and consulting before switching gears. The data was never supposed to be my main focus in those roles, yet I was always more interested in combing through it to uncover a new lead or an undiscovered pattern than doing anything else. From constructing dashboards to identifying critical metrics for individual team members to improve their performance, I kept finding myself knee-deep in data. After years of tinkering, I took the plunge and have immersed myself in the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, and all things predictive. I am eager to see what I will discover moving forward.</p>
