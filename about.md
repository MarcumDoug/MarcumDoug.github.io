<p>Hello, my name is Doug, and I am currently completing my capstone course for my Master of Data Science degree from Bellevue University. My background is a little unique for someone in the Data Science world, as I spent a number of years in talent acquisition, sales, management, and consulting. Even though the data was not supposed to be my focus, I was always more interested in combing through the data to uncover a new lead or undiscovered occurrence than anything else. From constructing dashboards to figuring our specific metrics for individual team members to improve their performance, I was pulled to the data. After years of self-training, I took the deep plunge and have immersed myself in the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and all things predictive.  I am eager to see what I will discover moving forward.</p>
