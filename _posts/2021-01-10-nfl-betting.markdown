## NFL, Machine Learning, and Gambling  
<p align="justify">Sports betting is not a new phenomenon in the United States, but due to recent legislation, it is experiencing a surge. With 25 states now allowing their residents to wager on sporting events in varying capacities, consumers are searching for tools to assist in making predictions or rather, to gain an edge in their selection process. Resources are available, but often they are not validated, are high priced, and do not provide any true guidance. With the work being conducted under this proposal, the hope is that through data science, the average gambler can be informed in making their selections.</p>    

<p align="justify">By analyzing ten, 10, NFL seasons consisting of 256 unique games each season, classification models can be implemented and tested to see if accuracy rates exceeding 52.4% can consistently be processed. If this is successful, future research into other professional arenas (basketball, baseball, soccer, hockey) can be reviewed. Sports betting, once considered to be taboo and sinful, has grown into a true corporate enterprise. Given this overall popularity, the field is just being explored, and the need for data scientist to engage and discover insights will continue to increase. This paper illustrates that machine learning can successfully predict winning and losing teams (approximate accuracy of 65%), as well as provide an edge in predicting if a team will cover a spread or if a game will be under or over an estimated total score.</p>
