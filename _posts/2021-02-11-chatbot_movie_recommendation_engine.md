## Conversational Movie Recommending Chatbot  
<p align='justify'>Chatbots are an excellent tool for communication being utilized by nearly every industry. It is estimated that chatbot chat sessions can cut customer service costs by more than 30%, and it is estimated that chatbots will help reduce business costs by approximately $8 billion by the year 2022. On any given day, we can expect to interact with a chatbot in some form. From contact customer service to booking a flight or asking for the weather, chatbots are becoming engrained in our society. With this, why is there still resistance to their full utilization? Most surveys show that the average consumer would still prefer to have direct contact with a human instead of working through a chatbot. Is this related to poor chatbot design? Is it a generational issue? Before being able to explain complex questions like these, the understanding of chatbots and the elements they are composed of must be examined. This project is designed in a manner to allow for exploration into two arenas, recommendation engines and conversational chatbots. A functioning movie recommendation engine was integrated into a Rasa generated chatbot to highlight and showcase elements from each.</p>
